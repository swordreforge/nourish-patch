Nourish is a Linux desktop where your screen is a window onto **one endless canvas**.
Spread your work out, zoom in to focus, zoom out to see everything — nothing gets buried,
nothing gets lost. Close the lid, come back tomorrow, and find it just as you left it.

It's free, open source, and runs on Fedora 44 today — stable enough that we drive it daily,
NVIDIA included.

## Glossary

The whole desktop is a handful of ideas. Everything else is built from these:

```
Nourish — one endless desktop
│
├─ Canvas        — one endless, zoomable surface; windows sit side by side, never stacked
│  ├─ Zoom       — step in to focus or out to see everything; text and video stay crisp
│  └─ Navigation — fly to a neighbouring window with a keystroke; hands stay on the keys
├─ Worlds        — many independent canvases; one key switches, each remembers itself
│  └─ Picker     — a gentle 3D screen showing every world as a tile to fly into
├─ Groups        — a named bundle of windows you line up, space out, or collapse to its name
├─ Placeholders  — the outline a closed or crashed app leaves behind; one tap restores it in place
├─ Capture       — screenshot or hardware-encoded H.264 video of a window, a region, or the screen
├─ Launcher      — a keyboard finder that starts any app
├─ Backdrop      — a living parallax scene that drifts behind your work
└─ Lock screen   — a clean lock screen with a real password prompt behind it
```

## What makes it different

🗺️ &nbsp;**One endless canvas.** Your windows live side by side instead of stacked in a pile.
The screen simply glides and zooms across them, and everything stays crisp at any zoom.

📌 &nbsp;**Things stay where you put them.** Finding your work feels like glancing across a
desk, not digging through a stack.

🪟 &nbsp;**Groups.** Gather a handful of windows, line them up, and give the bunch a name —
then collapse it down to just that name when you need it out of the way.

🌱 &nbsp;**A desktop that heals itself.** When an app closes — or crashes — Nourish leaves a
quiet outline where it was. One tap brings it back: same spot, same size. Your layout is
saved to disk, so it survives a full reboot too.

🪐 &nbsp;**Many canvases, one keystroke.** Want a clean slate? Flick to a whole separate
canvas. Keep "work" and "play" apart — each one remembers itself between sessions.

🎥 &nbsp;**Capture anything.** Screenshot or record a window, a region that follows your pan
and zoom, or the whole screen — even with a transparent background for clean overlays.

🖥️ &nbsp;**Runs on your hardware.** NVIDIA, Intel, or AMD; a stable Vulkan renderer with a
GLES fallback for older cards. Built natively on Wayland, and older X11 apps run too.

## Install

On Fedora 44, it's one command. You get a prebuilt build, so there's no toolchain to set up:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://nourish.snowies.com/release/latest/fedora44/package.tar.gz | tar -xz && y5-install/install.sh
```

The installer is interactive and safe to re-run. For the full walkthrough see
[`compositor.installer/INSTALL.md`](compositor.installer/INSTALL.md).

Prefer a pinned build? Every release is also published immutably under its version —
`https://nourish.snowies.com/release/v1.0.0/fedora44/package.tar.gz` — while `latest`
always points at the newest. Browse them on the
[releases page](https://github.com/y5-snowies/nourish/releases).

## Made in the open

Anyone can read exactly how Nourish is made. Under the hood the engine is called **`y5`** — a
Wayland compositor written in Rust, standing on patched forks of
[smithay](https://github.com/Smithay/smithay) (Wayland), [bevy](https://bevyengine.org) +
[wgpu](https://wgpu.rs) (rendering), and [iced](https://iced.rs) (interface), all kept
in-tree under `vendor/`.

```bash
# Build & run nested in your current Wayland session
environment/run-host.sh winit debug

# Build a release install bundle (compositor + components + installer)
ci/scripts/package-installer.sh
```
