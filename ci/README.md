# ci/ — the y5 CI/CD pipeline

A single pipeline that runs on **two platforms** — GitHub Actions (production) and GitLab
CI (the current self-hosted remote) — sharing exactly one copy of the real logic.

## Design: thin YAML, portable scripts

```
ci/scripts/*.sh        ← ALL logic. Plain, portable shell.
.github/workflows/*    ← thin: `run: ci/scripts/X.sh`
.gitlab-ci.yml         ← thin: includes ci/.gitlab/*.yml, each `script: ci/scripts/X.sh`
```

The only platform awareness anywhere is the `is_github` / `is_gitlab` predicates in
`ci/scripts/lib.sh`, used by the three scripts that must talk to a platform API (post a
PR/MR comment, open the promotion request, upload nothing else). Discovery, build,
coverage, packaging and report-generation are identical on both.

## Scripts

| Script | Does |
| --- | --- |
| `lib.sh` | shared helpers (repo root, bin-crate discovery, platform predicates) |
| `discover-workspaces.sh` | emit the **workspace entries** (dirs with `Cargo.toml` **and** `link.json`) as JSON / lines — drives the GitHub matrix and the GitLab child pipeline |
| `gen-child-pipeline.sh` | GitLab-only: entries → a child pipeline (lint/build/test/coverage per entry + a merge job) |
| `link-drift.sh` | re-run `workspace.link.js` in every entry with a generated links block; fail if the committed block is stale (the "forgot `link.all.sh`" guard) |
| `coverage-full.sh` | per-entry coverage **including dead code** (LLVM region baseline + unit-test merge) → `.ci-coverage/<slug>.lcov` |
| `merge-coverage.sh` | fuse all entry lcov → `coverage.lcov` + `cobertura.xml` + `html/` + **per-crate `coverage-crates.md`** + self-hosted **`coverage.svg`** badge + a `Coverage: NN.N%` line |
| `build-docs.sh` | rustdoc per entry + landing page → `public/`; folds in the coverage report + badge when present |
| `build-site.sh` | full Pages build: run coverage for every entry → merge → `build-docs.sh` (docs + coverage in one site) |
| `doc-suggest.sh` | PR/MR-only: `claude -p` reviews the diff, posts doc/README suggestions as a comment (advisory, never commits) |
| `gen-report.sh` | compose the markdown promotion "deployment notes" (tests/coverage/lint/drift/doc) |
| `open-promotion-pr.sh` | open/update the upstream-integration→upstream PR/MR with the report (never merges) |
| `package-installer.sh` | **the CD bundle builder** — delegates to `compositor.installer/prepare.sh` to build the full install bundle (installer + compositor/dev/polkit/mx/xwayland binaries + components) → `dist/package.tar.gz` + `SHA256SUMS`. Served at `/release/latest/fedora44/` (what `get.sh` fetches) and attached to Releases |
| `package-release.sh` | manual/raw: build just the udev+winit compositor binaries as a tarball (not used by the automated CD path — `package-installer.sh` is) |

All scripts work locally too: `Y5_REPO_ROOT=$(pwd) ci/scripts/discover-workspaces.sh`.

## CI image — `ci/Containerfile`

Lean **Fedora 44**: rustup `stable` + `rustfmt`/`clippy`/`llvm-tools-preview`, the
Wayland/GPU/protobuf **-devel** headers (build needs headers + link libs, no GPU at run
time), `nodejs`, `lcov`, `llvm`, `cargo-llvm-cov`, `lcov_cobertura`, `sccache`,
`gh`, and the `claude` CLI. It copies **no source** and installs **no runtime apps**
(unlike `environment.container/Containerfile`). Pushed to GHCR (GitHub) and the GitLab
registry as `…/y5-ci:fedora44`; every job runs inside it.

`sccache` is enabled via `RUSTC_WRAPPER=sccache` baked into the image — the documented
"turn it on only in CI, no repo changes" hook from `environment/README.md`. The repo's
`.cargo/config.toml` (`-A warnings`) is inherited untouched.

## Workspace entries

The build/test/coverage unit. An *entry* is a directory (≤ 2 deep, excluding `target/`)
holding both a workspace-root `Cargo.toml` **and** a `link.json`. Today there are 9.
Nothing is hardcoded, so adding/renaming a workspace needs **no pipeline edit**.

## Branch flow

```
feature → upstream-integration ──(CI green)──▶ auto PR/MR →upstream ──(you approve)──▶ upstream
        │ candidate bundle artifact                                                       │
        │ (ci.yml installer-bundle)                                          Publish: site + docs +
        │                                                                    install bundle to Pages
        │                                                                    (/release/latest/fedora44)
        │                                                                            │
        │                                                                    tag vX.Y.Z
        │                                                                            ▼
        │                                                       Release: install bundle attached (CD)
```

- **upstream-integration** (candidate): full CI on every push; the `installer-bundle` job
  builds the full install bundle as a downloadable artifact so the candidate can be tried
  before merge. On green, the promotion PR/MR to `upstream` is opened/updated with the report.
- **upstream** (publish): protected — approve & merge the promotion request manually (set
  branch protection / approval rules in the platform UI). A push here runs **Publish**, which
  deploys the marketing site (`/`), docs (`/docs`) **and the install bundle**
  (`/release/latest/fedora44/package.tar.gz` + `SHA256SUMS`) to Pages — the URL
  `compositor.installer/get.sh` fetches.
- **tag `v*`**: attaches the same install bundle to a GitHub/GitLab Release for manual
  download (CD). Live host deploy (`environment/build-release.sh remote`) is a separate,
  optional, manual job.

The install bundle is built by `compositor.installer/prepare.sh` (via `package-installer.sh`)
and contains every shipped binary + component + the interactive `y5-install`; building it in
CI is why the image carries the dev-tool window's GTK/WebKit `-devel` deps.

## Required secrets / variables (set in the platform UI, never in the repo)

| Name | Platform | Used by | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `GITHUB_TOKEN` | GitHub | image (GHCR), coverage, doc-review, promote, release | auto-provided |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | both | doc-review | masked; without it doc-review skips cleanly |
| `CI_REGISTRY_*` | GitLab | image | auto-provided |
| `GITLAB_TOKEN` | GitLab | doc-review, promote | project access token, `api` scope, masked |
| `Y5_DEPLOY_SSH_KEY` | GitLab (optional) | deploy-remote | masked SSH key for `yrd.local` |

## Notes / decisions

- **clippy is advisory**, fmt is blocking — the repo sets `-A warnings` globally in
  `.cargo/config.toml`, so a blocking `clippy -D warnings` would fight that policy.
- **First run:** the image job must publish `y5-ci:fedora44` before other jobs can run in
  it (trigger `image` once manually / via `workflow_dispatch`).
- **GitHub Pages / branch protection / approvals** are platform settings, not repo files.
