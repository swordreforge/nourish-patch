# Build the full public/ site for Pages: full coverage (per entry) + merged report +
# rustdoc + landing page. Used by the docs/pages job so the published site carries the
# self-hosted coverage badge and per-crate report — no third-party coverage service.
#
# (PR runs gate coverage in ci.yml without publishing; this is the master/Pages build.)
