//! REINSTATED as a real implementation (user directive): the de-delegation
//! crates exist with working mechanism bodies, compiled under the
//! `native-scanout` cargo feature and exercised by the assembly self-test
//! (TEST_ONLY atomic commits, kernel-validated on the real device).
//!
//! Atomic submission: the three commit shapes the machine performs. TEST_ONLY
//! is the kernel-side validation primitive — the self-test's proof and the
//! mode fallback chain's future native attempt. Failure policy: a TEST that
//! fails returns the error (callers branch — that IS the validating use);
//! a real commit that fails panics outside the resume window, matching
//! `flip.queue`.
