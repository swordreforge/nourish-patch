//! REINSTATED as a real implementation (user directive): the de-delegation
//! crates exist with working mechanism bodies, compiled under the
//! `native-scanout` cargo feature and exercised by the assembly self-test
//! (TEST_ONLY atomic commits, kernel-validated on the real device).
//!
//! Acquire fences -> IN_FENCE_FD: materialization (syncobj -> sync_file) and
//! attachment onto the plane in an atomic request. The render side reaches
//! this through `vulkan.sync/sync.export` (timeline point -> syncobj) or,
//! once EGL native fences land, the gles equivalent.
//!
//! Carried caveat from the hosted compositor: IN_FENCE_FD makes commits fail
//! on the NVIDIA driver — the wiring site consults `has_in_fence` first.
