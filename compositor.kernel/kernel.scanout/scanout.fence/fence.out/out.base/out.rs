//! REINSTATED as a real implementation (user directive): the de-delegation
//! crates exist with working mechanism bodies, compiled under the
//! `native-scanout` cargo feature and exercised by the assembly self-test
//! (TEST_ONLY atomic commits, kernel-validated on the real device).
//!
//! OUT_FENCE_PTR harvesting: the kernel writes a sync_file fd describing the
//! commit's completion into caller-owned memory. The slot owns that memory
//! (boxed, address-stable) for the lifetime of the commit and yields the fd
//! afterwards — presentation feedback for the explicit-sync era.
