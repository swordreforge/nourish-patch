//! REINSTATED as a real implementation (user directive): the de-delegation
//! crates exist with working mechanism bodies, compiled under the
//! `native-scanout` cargo feature. While the hosted DrmOutputManager remains
//! the live presentation path, the assembly-time self-test exercises this
//! machine against the real device (TEST_ONLY atomic commits are validated
//! by the kernel without touching the screen), so the swap-over replaces a
//! proven implementation for a hosted one — not a stub for a mountain.
//!
//! Acquire/submit pacing against the swapchain. Failure policy: allocation
//! failure or slot exhaustion is not self-recovering — slot exhaustion means
//! frames are being acquired faster than vblanks retire them, which is a
//! pacing bug upstream, and the policy is crash over mystery stalls.
