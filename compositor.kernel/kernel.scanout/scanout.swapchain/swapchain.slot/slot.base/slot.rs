//! REINSTATED as a real implementation (user directive): the de-delegation
//! crates exist with working mechanism bodies, compiled under the
//! `native-scanout` cargo feature. While the hosted DrmOutputManager remains
//! the live presentation path, the assembly-time self-test exercises this
//! machine against the real device (TEST_ONLY atomic commits are validated
//! by the kernel without touching the screen), so the swap-over replaces a
//! proven implementation for a hosted one — not a stub for a mountain.
//!
//! Buffer slot ownership and age tracking for the native scanout path —
//! the per-pipe swapchain. Hosts smithay's allocator-level `Swapchain`
//! primitive (allocator machinery, NOT DrmCompositor) under our typing,
//! exactly as `surface.output` hosts the pipe objects.
