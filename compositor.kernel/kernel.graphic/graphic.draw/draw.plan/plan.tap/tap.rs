//! Tap identity + subscription registry (Law 5).
//!
//! A tap is a named point between frame passes where the rendered state may be
//! observed. Consumers (capture pipes, future screencast) subscribe to a tap by
//! identity and never learn what the surrounding passes mean. Capture adaptation
//! is out of scope for now; the identity type is what the frame plan carries.

/// Identity of a tap point. Compared by name.

/// The tap placed after the scene pass and before any lock pass.
/// This is where the capture registry observes today (it must never see lock content).
pub const POST_SCENE: TapPoint = TapPoint("post-scene");

/// The tap observing the final composited frame (everything, lock included).
pub const FINAL: TapPoint = TapPoint("final");

/// Minimal subscription bookkeeping. Executors ask `is_active` before paying
/// the cost of a blit; consumers flip subscriptions on and off by identity.
