//! The renderer contract. One renderer among peers (gles today, vulkan
//! arriving) implements this; hosts select through it. There is NO fallback
//! between renderers: a selected renderer that cannot run panics at assembly.
//!
//! Constraint (recorded in the architecture document): this crate must not
//! require the `renderer_gl` smithay feature. It speaks in renderer-agnostic
//! vocabulary only: format sets, dmabufs, display handles, fds.
//!
//! REVISION (Phase 4 Step 6), informed by what the vulkan work proved:
//! - import is modifier-aware: `supported_formats()` exposes the negotiated
//!   (fourcc x modifier) set so the linux-dmabuf global advertises exactly
//!   what the active renderer can take.
//! - explicit sync is a first-class capability: `export_render_fence` is the
//!   render-completion side; `sync_capable()` tells the syncobj protocol
//!   whether the renderer honors acquire points natively.
